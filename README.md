# Radial_Search
##### A simple MKB script to search for a block nearby. It searches within a rectangular prism that can be customized.

- **Installation**
	- Open Minecraft singleplayer;
	- Open the Macro KeyBind Mod keyboard screen;
	- Open one of the gray keys;
	- Type the following code:
		 `$$<Mexican_Snake.txt>`
	- Click the button `Edit File`;
	- Type `radial_search` and press `Create`;
	- Paste the script and Save.
- **Usage**
	- The script is easy to custom. You can change the ID of the item you are looking for, the 2d (XZ plane) radius up to which you'd like to search and also the vertical limits (making it a rectangular prism).
	- To test it out the way it is, just go in Minecraft Singleplayer and place a `bed` somewhere near you, then run the script.
	  - The nearer you are to the bed, the faster the script will find it.
